        This function takes a positional argument called "the_list", which

        provided list is (recursively) printed to the screen on itâ€™s own line.

        A second argument called "indent" controls whether or not indentation is
        shown on the display. This defaults to False: set it to True to switch on.

        A third argument called "level" (which defaults to 0) is used to insert 
        tab-stops when a nested list is encountered.

        A fourth argument called "fh" identifies the file to write to (which is 
        assumed to be opened and writeable to). This defaults to "sys.stdout", 
        i.e., standard output."""
